# 310-Calendar-Project
### About the Project

The project we will be developing for Computer Science 310 is an automated scheduler. The program works by automatically scheduling events or assignments into your schedule. The program does this by taking into account multiple variables and then uses this data to compute and automatically schedule your day. The user also has the option to create a fixed block for events that cannot be moved like plans with friends or business meetings. We chose to make this app a web program to increase compatibility and to enable users across various product ecosystems to use this app.
We chose the Waterfall Model, a plan-driven model, that would have separate and distinct phases of specification, development, validation and evolution. The requirements are defined early in the project, which will enable our team to define a project scope and create a complete schedule.
